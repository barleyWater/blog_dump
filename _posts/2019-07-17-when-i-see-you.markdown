当我见到你，我的手指<br />
上就沾到了杏汁和熟透了的蓝莓<br />
甜渍。如果我写字，证据就会在纸上落得到处都是<br />

当我见到你<br />
月亮不是月亮，是一朵银白色的鸽子，在云间<br />
扑朔地走丢了<br />
我的心脏不是心脏。是这挂白月亮<br />

你的睫毛上<br />
盛着旧远晨曦中，一片白丁香的花瓣<br />

当我见到你，胸腔里就有绒布缠抱的小灯泡，那些一串串圆形鹅黄的温暖太阳，曾经在2017年的感恩节，被人们挂在游人如织的布莱恩公园集市，还有松心木的旁边。陌生的情人曾在底下的深秋里亲吻，可丽饼白奶油和草莓的香气，在微微发凉的夜幕里，如喝了甜酒的光晕一般<br />
浮动<br />

当我见到你<br />
我想起我所有曾当作爱过的人<br />
以前懵懂，无知那些只是站在爱河的<br />
堤岸上眺望。而它如今涨起，像尼罗河<br />
漫涌埃及<br />

我见到你，当我见到你。我就因为还未发生的离别隐隐作痛<br />
因为还未发生的对话<br />
心神飘忽<br />

 <br />

***

 <br />

When I see you, my fingers<br />
They are covered with juice of apricot and the sweet stains of<br />
Ripe blueberries. If I were to write, I would leave evidence all over the page.<br />

When I see you,<br />
The moon is not a moon. It is a silver-white pigeon, wandering in the clouds,<br />
Fluttering yet lost.<br />
My heart is not a heart. It is this hanging white moon.<br />

On your eyelashes<br />
Holds a petal of white lilac from an old far fair morning.<br />

When I see you, I have small light bulbs wrapped in flannel in my chest. Those strings of round, goose-yellow warm sun were once hanged in Bryant Park on Thanksgiving of 2017 with people wandering in and out. They shone next to the heartwood.  Lovers who I never met again once kissed in the late autumn, with the scent of white cream and strawberry on crepe. In the slightly cool night, the scent, like halos of the sweet liqueur, were<br />
Floating<br />

When I see you<br />
I think of all the people I ever thought I have loved.<br />
I were naïve; not knowing that I were just standing on the bank
Of love, gazing. And it is now rising, like the Nile<br />
Flooded Egypt<br />

I see you; when I see you. I am faint because of the separation that has not happened yet.<br />
Frustrated<br />
Because of those conversations which have not occurred yet<br />
